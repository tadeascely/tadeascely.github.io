My main interest is to uncover the roots of public opinion and affective polarization with a particular focus on ideology. I am a research associate and PhD candidate at [**Masaryk University**](https://www.muni.cz/en/people/460075-tadeas-cely).In the course of my research, I have been awarded an **AKTION fellowship**, a **Fulbright fellowship**, and the [**Jacques Rupnik Prize**](https://www.eui.eu/en/projects/political-behaviour-in-central-and-eastern-europe/jacques-rupnik-prize) for the best PhD presentation.

I used to be a Fulbright Fellow at [**Polarization Research Lab**](https://polarizationresearchlab.org/team/) (Stanford, University of Pennsylvania, and **Dartmouth**) throughout the 2023/24 academic year and a visiting researcher at the [**University of Vienna**](https://staatswissenschaft.univie.ac.at/en/) in Spring 2023. I also currently serve as a research secretary of the [**Czech Political Science Association**](https://www.czechpsa.org/home).

My research focuses on belief alignment and political polarization in Europe. I explore how historical church-state conflicts shape cultural divides on moral issues between Catholic and Protestant countries. I also examine ideological asymmetry, finding that left-wing partisans tend to have more coherent beliefs, but emerging sociocultural conflicts challenge this alignment. Additionally, I study emotional responses to policy disagreement, showing that ideologues react more strongly due to both observed and anticipated disagreements. I use quantitative and computational methods to analyze these dynamics.

There's a [document CV](Tadeáš_Celý___Curriculum_Vitae.pdf) for more.
