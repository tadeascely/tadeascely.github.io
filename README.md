**Dissertation (theses)**:
 * In Europe, opinion in Catholic countries is more divided by culture wars than in Protestant countries. This pattern is stable, unlike the effect of development, which fades over time. Delving into this result, I demonstrate a pattern of generational replacement in less developed contexts, which has shaped the diminishing effect of development. Culture wars may be more rooted in historical conflicts than previously assumed. [Preprint](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/cu82k), [Supplement](https://osf.io/eay9j), *Under Review*
 * In this paper, I demonstrate the propensity of left-wing partisans to align their beliefs ideologically with their parties, also showing them to be a group more coherent in their beliefs than other parties. However, I also reveal a shift in this asymmetry concerning sociocultural issues, indicative of emergent ideological conflicts among partisans across European countries. Finally, I observe only limited effects on other party ideological characteristics, such as nicheness and position blurring, [Preprint](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/fgpt3) (supplement included), *Under Review* 
 * In the last piece, I empirically differentiate between ideological and non-ideological policy disagreement. I show that both types stimulate a different kind of emotional response, because ideologues disagree not only on beliefs they observe, but also those which they can predict. Finally, I describe how ambivalence can also lead to substantial dislike.  ~~Preprint~~ (Summer 2024), *Currently conducting a follow-up study*
