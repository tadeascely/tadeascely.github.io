A political polarization researcher. [CV](Tadeáš_Celý___Curriculum_Vitae.pdf)
* Fulbright Fellow at Polarization Research Lab (Stanford, UPenn, Dartmouth, based at **Dartmouth College**)
* Research associate and PhD candidate at **Masaryk University**
  
_Formerly_:
* visiting researcher at **University of Vienna** 

**Research (theses)**:
 * In Europe, opinion in Catholic countries is more divided by culture wars than in Protestant countries. This pattern is stable, unlike the effect of development, which fades over time. Culture wars may be more rooted in historical conflicts than previously assumed. [Preprint](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/cu82k), [Supplement](https://osf.io/eay9j)
 * Looking at the divisive potential and the hatred they inspire, radical right supporters are often regarded as an ideological extreme. However, their political views are strikingly incoherent to live up to this reputation, even if they correspond to inconsistent party positions in a two-dimensional ideological space. This is paradoxical since there are fewer issues most might disagree about with radical right supporters than some moderate parties.

 * Belief constraint matters for partisan animosity, but we mostly dislike different-minded ideologues. Similar-minded ideologues might be preferred over unopinionated people. Also, I show that policy disagreement along the main ideological line correlates more hatred than disagreement between people with eclectic beliefs. Therefore, I argue that hatred due to disagreement is more prevalent when mirroring predominant political conflict. ~~Preprint~~ (Spring 2024), Pre-registration below
