A political polarization researcher. [Document CV](Tadeáš_Celý___Curriculum_Vitae.pdf)
* Fulbright Fellow at Polarization Research Lab (Stanford, UPenn, Dartmouth, based at **Dartmouth College**)
* Research associate and PhD candidate at **Masaryk University**
  
_Formerly_:
* visiting researcher at **University of Vienna** 

**Dissertation (theses)**:
 * In Europe, opinion in Catholic countries is more divided by culture wars than in Protestant countries. This pattern is stable, unlike the effect of development, which fades over time. Culture wars may be more rooted in historical conflicts than previously assumed. [Preprint](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/cu82k), [Supplement](https://osf.io/eay9j)
 * Looking at the divisive potential and the hatred they inspire, radical right supporters are often regarded as an ideological extreme. However, their political views are strikingly incoherent to live up to this reputation, even if they correspond to inconsistent party positions in a two-dimensional ideological space. This is paradoxical since there are fewer issues most might disagree about with radical right supporters than some moderate parties.

 * In the last piece, I empirically differentiate between ideological and non-ideological policy disagreement. I show that both types stimulate a different kind of emotional response, because ideologues disagree not only on beliefs they observe, but also those which they can predict. Finally, I describe how ambivalence can also lead to substantial dislike.  ~~Preprint~~ (Summer 2024), [Presentiation (Preliminary)](https://tadeascely.github.io/docs/present.html), *Currently conducting a follow-up study*
