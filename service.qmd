### Doctoral Workshop in Political Research

A new format of regular research workshops at Masaryk University takes place twice a term. At these workshops, pre-doctoral and post-doctoral researchers can present their research to colleagues and faculty members. The workshops also include guests from other departments (notably psychology and security studies), providing an interdisciplinary perspective that greatly benefits some researchers.

As of today, there have been **6 such meetings** with **17 paper presentations**. This is a joint activity with my colleague Jakub Jusko and others. I also appreciate the help of numerous faculty members and PhD candidates throughout this seminar.
